```{r}

library(kuzco)
```

## a typical workflow for a single image

#### define a path to an image 
we have an image within kuzco to get started. But feel free to substitute this image with any image of your choice. 
```{r}
my_image <- file.path(system.file(package = "kuzco", "img/test_img.jpg"))
```


#### view the input image
to make things easy, there is a new function in kuzco to see an image, `view_image`. 
```{r}
my_image |>
  view_image()
```


#### apply computer vision 
decide on an llm_image_* function to call:     
 - llm_image_alt_text     
 - llm_image_classification     
 - llm_image_extract_text       
 - llm_image_recognition         
 - llm_image_sentiment         
 - llm_image_custom        
       
       
```r
 llm_results <- 
   my_image |>
    llm_image_classification(llm_model = "qwen2.5vl")

```

#### view the output results
 easily view the results from kuzco:
```r
llm_results |>
  view_llm_results() 
```

## computer vision app

in addtion, kuzco has a shiny app implementation within the package. the entire workflow above can be ran within a GUI like so:

```r
kuzco_app()
```
