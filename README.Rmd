{kuzco} is a simple vision boilerplate built for ollama in R, on top of {ollamar} & {ellmer}. {kuzco} is designed as a computer vision assistant, giving local models guidance on classifying images and return structured data. The goal is to standardize outputs for image classification and use LLMs as an alternative option to keras or torch. 

{kuzco} currently supports: classification, recognition, sentiment, text extraction, alt-text creation, and **custom** computer vision tasks.

## Installation

You can install the development version of kuzco like so:

``` r
devtools::install_github("frankiethull/kuzco")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to use kuzco.
```{r example, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(kuzco)
library(ollamar)
```

here we have an image and want to learn about it:
```{r}
test_img <- file.path(system.file(package = "kuzco"), "img/test_img.jpg") 
```

### llm for image classification:
```{r}
llm_results <- llm_image_classification(llm_model = "qwen2.5vl", image = test_img, 
                                        backend = 'ollamar')
```

```{r}
llm_results |> tibble::as_tibble()
```

```{r}
llm_results |> str()
```

### llm for image sentiment:
```{r}
llm_emotion <- llm_image_sentiment(llm_model = "qwen2.5vl", image = test_img)

llm_emotion |> str()
```

### llm for image recognition:

note that the backend of kuzco is flexible as well. This allows users to specify between 'ollamar', which suggests structured outputs, while 'ellmer' enforces structured outputs. 
```{r}
llm_detection <- llm_image_recognition(llm_model = "qwen2.5vl", 
                                       image = test_img,
                                       recognize_object = "nose",
                                       backend  = "ollamar")

llm_detection |> str()
```
### llm for image text extraction:

kuzco is also useful for OCR tasks, extracting text from images is showcased below:
```{r}
text_img <- file.path(system.file(package = "kuzco"), "img/text_img.jpg") 

text_img |> view_image()
```

```{r}
llm_extract_txt <- llm_image_extract_text(llm_model = "qwen2.5vl", 
                                          image = text_img,
                                          backend  = "ellmer")

llm_extract_txt |> str()
```


## newer features

### llm image customization:

a new feature in kuzco, is a fully customizable function. This allows users to further test computer vision techniques without leaving the kuzco boilerplate. 
```{r}
llm_customized <- llm_image_custom(llm_model = "qwen2.5vl", 
                                   image = test_img,
                                   system_prompt = "you are a dog breed expert, you know all about dogs. 
                                                    tell me the primary breed, secondary breed, and a brief description about both.",
                                   image_prompt  = "tell me what kind of dog is in the image?",
                                   example_df = data.frame(
                                     dog_breed_primary = "hound",
                                     dog_breed_secondary = "corgi",
                                     dog_breed_information = "information about the primary and secondary breed"
                                   ))

llm_customized |> str()

```

### additional enhancements:

#### i/o helpers    
kuzco now has `view_image` & `view_llm_results` functions within the package, making it easy to view images and display llm results. In addition to this, kuzco now features `kuzco_app` a fully functioning shiny application within the package. Making it even easier to do computer vision with LLMs in R. 

#### cloud-based LLMs     
    
kuzco now supports all LLM providers that are supported by `ellmer`! That's correct, you can now send images to Perplexity, Claude, OpenAI, Gemini, the list goes on. This defaults to "ollama" to maintain the original workflows.     
    
*Cloud-hosted LLMs generally offer greater speed and more advanced capabilities, but require users to obtain an API key since inference is handled remotely. While some providers offer a free tier with usage limits, others do not. Keep in mind that using a cloud-hosted LLM comes with less privacy compared to running a model locally, but it enables access to powerful, cutting-edge models. To get started, users should set up their API key in their environment and select a provider-hosted model that supports image processing.*    
   

A mistral example below using pixtral-12b, which is still a pretty small model. But leverages mistral's compute, instead of yours. 

```r
# via base R:
Sys.setenv(MISTRAL_API_KEY = "the_api_key_via_the_provider")
# or usethis:
usethis::edit_r_environ()
```
  
```{r}
kuzco::llm_image_classification(provider = "mistral", llm_model = "pixtral-12b", image = test_img)
```
